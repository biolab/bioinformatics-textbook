\section{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming, a term coined by Richard Bellman in the 1950s,
\marginpar{\raggedright Bellman, R. (1952). On the Theory of Dynamic Programming. {\em Proc. of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA}, 38(8), 716â€“719.}
is named to describe a method of solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Bellman chose the term "dynamic programming" for strategic reasons. At the time, he was working with the U.S. government, where the word "programming" was a popular term and had positive associations, particularly in operations research and planning. By adding "dynamic," he aimed to emphasize the method's focus on time-evolving processes, as the problems it addressed often involved sequences of decisions over time.

In dynamic programming, solutions to subproblems are stored (or "memorized") to avoid redundant calculations, which makes it particularly efficient for problems with overlapping subproblems, like shortest path, sequence alignment, and optimization problems. The approach dynamically combines solutions to smaller subproblems to build up the solution to the original, larger problem, leading to a highly structured and systematic way of tackling complex problems.

\section{Protein Substitution Matrices}

Protein substitution matrices are essential in bioinformatics, particularly for scoring alignments between protein sequences by assessing the likelihood of amino acid substitutions that may have occurred over time. BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix), introduced by Henikoff and Henikoff in 1992, is among the most widely used matrices for this purpose. Derived from highly conserved protein regions, BLOSUM matrices help detect similarity between protein sequences by analyzing regions, or "blocks," that remain largely unchanged across members of protein families.



The BLOSUM matrices were derived from data in the BLOCKS database, which contained about 500 conserved regions, or "blocks," from approximately 200 protein families.
\marginpar{A protein family is a group of proteins that share a common evolutionary origin, often re\-flected in similar structures, functions, or sequence motifs.} 
Each block represented a stable, functionally important region within a protein family that has remained largely unchanged over evolutionary time. By focusing on these conserved regions with minimal variation, researchers could analyze meaningful substitutions that likely reflect evolutionary relationships. This made the BLOCKS database an ideal resource for deriving substitution scores that capture genuine evolutionary patterns.

To create BLOSUM matrices, sequences within each block were grouped, or "clustered," according to a specific similarity threshold. Clustering in this context means that sequences within a block that share more than the specified percentage of similarity (e.g., 62\% for BLOSUM62) are grouped together as a single "cluster." Substitutions are then only counted between different clusters rather than within a cluster, reducing the influence of closely related sequences and emphasizing broader evolutionary changes. By capturing substitutions across clusters, BLOSUM matrices can better detect relationships in distantly related proteins.

\end{table}

The process to derive a BLOSUM matrix involved several key steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sequences within each block were grouped according to the similarity threshold, forming clusters for sequences above the threshold.
    \item Substitutions were then counted across these clusters. For each amino acid substitution occurring between clusters, a substitution frequency was recorded.
    \item Finally, substitution scores were calculated using the log-odds scoring formula for each amino acid pair $i, j$:
    
    \begin{equation}
    S(i, j) = \log \frac{P(i, j)}{P(i) \cdot P(j)}
    \end{equation}
    
    Here, $P(i, j)$ represents the observed probability of amino acid $i$ substituting for $j$, while $P(i)$ and $P(j)$ are the background probabilities of each amino acid. Positive scores suggest substitutions are more likely than chance, while negative scores indicate disfavored substitutions.
\end{enumerate}

Different BLOSUM matrices, like BLOSUM45, BLOSUM62, and BLOSUM80, cater to different levels of similarity. Lower-numbered BLOSUM matrices are suited for analyzing distantly related sequences, as they capture broader evolutionary trends. Higher-numbered matrices are more appropriate for closely related sequences. Among them, BLOSUM62 has become widely used, as it provides a balanced approach suitable for a range of sequence alignment tasks, including use in algorithms like BLAST.

PAM (Point Accepted Mutation) matrices, developed by Margaret Dayhoff and colleagues, take a different approach. Unlike BLOSUM, which is based on direct observations from protein blocks, PAM matrices are derived from a theoretical model of evolutionary change, focusing on closely related sequences. PAM1, the starting matrix, represents a 1\% divergence, meaning each amino acid has had a 1\% chance of mutating to another. Higher PAM matrices, like PAM250, are extrapolated from PAM1, estimating amino acid changes over more extended evolutionary periods.

The key differences between BLOSUM and PAM lie in their methodologies and applications. BLOSUM matrices rely on observed data from conserved protein regions and do not involve extrapolation, making them ideal for identifying more distant relationships between proteins. Conversely, PAM matrices are modeled on evolutionary theory and use extrapolation, making them better suited for closely related sequences in global alignments. Thus, while BLOSUM is preferred for broader sequence similarity searches, PAM matrices find their application in evolutionary studies requiring a focus on closely related sequences.

\section{Alignment with Affine Gaps}

In {\em alignment with affine gap penalties}, affine refers to a type of gap penalty that includes both a fixed cost to open a gap and an additional cost for each position the gap is extended. Instead of charging the same amount for each gap position, this approach applies a smaller cost to extend an existing gap than to start a new one. A simpler way to describe this might be adjustable or two-part gap penalties, emphasizing that the penalty adjusts based on whether the gap is being opened or extended.

\section{BLAST}

BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) identifies regions of similarity between sequences by comparing a query sequence to a database of known sequences. Unlike global alignment algorithms, which attempt to align entire sequences, BLAST uses \textit{local alignment}, focusing on finding high-similarity segments (subsequences) within larger sequences. This approach is computationally efficient and well-suited for detecting functional or evolutionary relationships across genomic and protein data.

The BLAST algorithm works in three main phases: \textbf{seeding}, \textbf{extension}, and \textbf{evaluation}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Seeding}: The algorithm first breaks down the query sequence into shorter words or "k-mers" of a fixed length (usually three residues for proteins, eleven for nucleotides). These k-mers are compared against all possible k-mers in the database. If the similarity between the query k-mer and a database k-mer meets a certain threshold score, it becomes a "seed" that may lead to a high-scoring alignment.
    
    \item \textbf{Extension}: For each seed match, BLAST extends the alignment in both directions, calculating a score for each extension by adding or subtracting points for matches, mismatches, and gaps based on a scoring matrix (e.g., BLOSUM for proteins, which gives positive scores to biologically likely substitutions). This process continues until the alignment score drops below a threshold, meaning no further extension would improve the alignment. The resulting segments, known as high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs), represent local regions of high similarity between the query and database sequence.
    
    \item \textbf{Evaluation and Ranking (E-value calculation)}: The significance of each HSP is assessed using a statistical measure called the \textit{E-value}, or "expect" value. The E-value estimates the number of alignments with a score equal to or greater than the observed score that could be expected by chance when searching a database of a given size. Itâ€™s calculated using the formula:

    \[
    E = K \times m \times n \times e^{-\lambda S}
    \]

    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( K \) and \( \lambda \) are statistical parameters dependent on the scoring system and sequence composition.
        \item \( m \) and \( n \) are the lengths of the query and database sequences, respectively.
        \item \( S \) is the raw alignment score of the HSP.
    \end{itemize}

    This formula is based on the extreme value distribution (EVD), which models the probability of obtaining an alignment score \( S \) by chance. Lower E-values indicate more significant alignments. For example, an E-value close to zero suggests the alignment is unlikely to be random, hinting at a meaningful biological relationship.
\end{enumerate}

By efficiently identifying and ranking local similarities, BLAST allows researchers to filter out biologically relevant hits from random alignments. Its computational efficiency and effectiveness have made it a cornerstone in bioinformatics, used for everything from annotating gene sequences to exploring evolutionary relationships.


\section{Multiple Sequence Alignment}

A popular technique and a software tool that implements a heuristic approach to multiple sequence alignment is CLUSTAL. 
\marginpar{\raggedright Thompson JD, Higgins DG, Gibson TJ (1994) CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice. {\em Nucleic Acids Research} 22(22):4673â€“4680.}
The term CLUSTAL derived from ``cluster alignment,'' reflecting the software's purpose of clustering and aligning multiple sequences. The name emphasizes its function in performing multiple sequence alignment by progressively clustering sequences based on their similarity. CLUSTAL works through a series of steps, typically following a progressive alignment approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Pairwise Alignment}: First, CLUSTAL calculates pairwise alignment scores for all pairs of sequences using methods such as Needleman-Wunsch (for global alignment) or Smith-Waterman (for local alignment). These scores quantify how similar each sequence pair is.
\item \textbf{Guide Tree Construction}: CLUSTAL then uses these pairwise alignment scores to build a guide tree, often by a method such as the neighbor-joining algorithm (more on this in the next chapter). This tree reflects the evolutionary relationships between sequences based on their similarity scores, determining the order in which sequences will be aligned.
\item \textbf{Progressive Alignment}: Using the guide tree, CLUSTAL progressively aligns sequences from most to least similar, starting with closely related pairs and gradually aligning less similar ones. At each step, previously aligned groups are treated as single units or "profiles" to ensure consistency across the alignment.
\end{enumerate}

CLUSTAL also applies gap penalties to optimize the alignment, balancing between matching conserved regions and introducing gaps where needed to account for insertions or deletions. This progressive process ensures that gaps are added in a way that preserves the most conserved sequence regions.
